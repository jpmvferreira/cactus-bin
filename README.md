This is my set of scripts stored in $CACTUS_ROOT/bin to manage my Einstein Toolkit installation.

To synchronize this folder between hosts, you need a `host.json` where with the format `host: folder`, where `host` should match an entry in your SSH configuration and `folder` is the absolute path to the Cactus installation in the remote machine `host`.
